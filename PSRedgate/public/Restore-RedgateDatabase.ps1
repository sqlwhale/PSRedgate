function Restore-RedgateDatabase
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This cmdlet is a wrapper for the stored procedure master..sqlbackup. Instead of trying to handle remoting and talking to the command line tool, this cmdlet will
        allow you to simply pass in parameters to execute restores on your servers.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Using this cmdlet, you can perform all of the normal operations that you would do using the redgate sql backup ui, or would write manually using SSMS.

    .EXAMPLE
        An example
