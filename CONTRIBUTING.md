# Bug triage

This sections explains how bug triaging is done for our project.

* You can look through the existing bugs on the issues page.
* You can help diagnose and fix existing bugs by asking and providing answers for the following:
  * Is the bug reproducible as explained?   
  * Is it reproducible in other environments (for instance, on different browsers or devices)?   
  * Are the steps to reproduce the bug clear? If not, can you describe how you might reproduce it?  
  * What tags should the bug have?  
  * Is this bug something you have run into? Would you appreciate it being looked into faster? 

# Translations

* You can help translate this project by submitting a PR with the translation. I would like to add localization at some point.

# Documentation

Code needs explanation, and sometimes those who know the code well have trouble explaining it to someone just getting into it. 

* Help with documentation by modifying the command's Help section and submitting a Pull Request.
